  // alecto dialogue
  "Alecto.dialogue.introduction": "How did you find me so quickly? Have you used some sort of reality-altering magic?$3",
	"Alecto.dialogue.Mon": "Don't mind me. Just foraging for mushrooms. They're most plentiful in the fall, true, but fungus is always in season.#$b#It's one of life's constants. Death, taxes and fungal decomposition!$1",
	"Alecto.dialogue.Tue": "Shhh. Shhhhhh.$5#$b#I'm sorry, darling, but I really can't chat. I have a terrible hangover.$2",
	"Alecto.dialogue.Wed": "Have you met my familiars? This one's Titania, and the other one is... Kevin.#$e#He was going to be called Oberon, but that's a name that demands a certain dignity and.. well... he's definitely more of a Kevin...$6",

  "Alecto.dialogue.Thu_a1": "Yes!",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Thu_a2": "Not really, no.",

  "Alecto.dialogue.Thu_no": "Hmph. I suppose that was a bit much to hope for...$6",

	"Alecto.dialogue.Sat": "Sometimes I think I ought to stop holding grudges. But people are just too annoying.$6",
	"Alecto.dialogue.Sun": "Have you ever seen a fairy, @? Awful little things. Used to wreak havoc on my herb garden back at the tower.$5",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Mon2": "What do you think of Marlon, @?#$b#I've known him since long before he lost the eye, but we were never exactly close.$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Tue2": "Herbs gathered under a full moon are particularly powerful.",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Wed2": "Corvids are extremely intelligent creatures, you know.#$b#...Kevin is an outlier and should not be counted.$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Thu2": "The energies of the mines are out of balance, and I'm unsure why.$2#$b#It makes collecting spell materials such a chore.$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Fri2": "You know the saying 'eats like a bird'? People use it to mean 'eats little and delicately', but really it should mean 'eats garbage and throws it on the floor.'$5#$e#Isn't that right, Kevin?$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Sat2": "Have you ever been to Calico Desert? Awful place, far too hot, but there are some powerful magical artifacts in the caverns.",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Sun2": "Today is a day for skincare and tiny snacks. Maybe a bubblebath...$7",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Mon4male": "The fact anyone in the magical community still associates with Ras speaks volumes on their poor character.$6#$b#He treats me like garbage, breaks my heart, and somehow I'm the villain?$5#$b#You set fire to ONE high council warlock and you never hear the end of it.$6#$e#Oh, don't worry, he's fine now. He simply learned a valuable lesson.$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Mon4female": "The fact anyone in the magical community still associates with Ras speaks volumes on their poor character.$6#$b#She treats me like garbage, breaks my heart, and somehow I'm the villain?$5#$b#You set fire to ONE high council warlock and you never hear the end of it.$6#$e#Oh, don't worry, he's fine now. He simply learned a valuable lesson.$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Tue4": "I've had flings since the divorce, but nothing serious. I certainly don't think I'll get married again. Once bitten, twice shy.",

  "Alecto.dialogue.Tue4_old2": "You understand, don't you?",

  "Alecto.dialogue.Fri4": "How's the mayor looking, @? A little under the weather?#$b#Oh, no reason. No reason at all. I certainly haven't been casting any nasty little hexes on him.$1",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Sat4": "*sigh*... I should really try and turn over a new leaf. Negative energy is bad for the skin.$2#$b#But then again so is wine, and I'm not going to give that up any time soon either.$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Sun4": "I make sure to use my special homemade facemask every week. It's a very simple recipe.#$b#Purified slime and seaweed extract, pureed strawberry, a pinch of gold dust and refined quartz, a couple of basic enchantments to keep it fresh, and voila!$1",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Mon6": "Has anyone ever told you that you have excellent bone structure? You should really take advantage of it more.",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Tue6": "You're an adventurous sort - have you come across any interesting artifacts lately?#$b#I've heard of some very powerful arcane relics being found in this area.",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Wed6male": "When I was young I adored getting flowers, but of course Ras ruined that for me too.$2#$b#He only ever gave them to me when he'd done something wrong.$6",

  "Alecto.dialogue.Fri6_a4": "No. I don't like children.",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Fri6_yes": "Ugh. Well, to each their own.$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Fri6_no": "Smart. They seem so... messy. Even compared to birds.$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Fri6_old1": "By the way, if you ever get tired of parenthood, just let me know... I have a certain shrine in my posession...$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Fri6_old2": "I prefer my birds. Much more independent. Although sometimes I think I'd be alright with swapping Kevin for a six-year-old.$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Sat6": "The magical council said they'll revoke my banishment if I apologise for setting fire to the head warlock. I've refused. He had it coming.$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Sun6": "I admit I may be hypocritical at times... I'm too set in my ways, I'm afraid.$2",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Mon8": "I don't worship the spirit of the mountains, as such. I simply understand that it's better to be on her good side...$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Tue8": "I hear you've been poking your curious little nose into Aguar's business. Oh, we go way back.$1#$b#He has excellent taste in wine. You should bully him to giving you some, I'm sure he's hiding some excellent vintages in that lab of his.$7",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Wed8": "Kevin got into my makeup drawer last night... a whole tube of my favorite lipstick wasted down his greedy gullet!$a",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Thu8": "I try to stay as far away from cities as possible. All that concrete and pollution can really mess with magic.",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Fri8": "I sent a letter to the magical council yesterday... a formal apology for the whole warlock arson incident.#$b#Ugh. I'm going soft. I blame you.$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Sat8": "I don't have any affinity for the mystical energy of the ocean, unfortunately. It's my only real flaw.",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Sun8": "I need to visit Wellwick again soon. She has terrible taste in alcohol and can't handle her liquor, but she's always good for a laugh.$1",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Mon10": "You know, @, you've pleasantly surprised me. That doesn't happen often.$4",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Tue10": "Don't be concerned if Titania jumps on your shoulder and starts preening your hair, it means she likes you!$1",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Wed10": "Ugh, I need a manicure. Foraging for potion ingredients does a real number on one's cuticles.$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Thu10": "I'm planning to spend a little time with Juna later, if you're interested in joining us.#$b#Don't take anything we say personally. You know how we are.$1",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Fri10": "Sometimes I think I ought to get a cat. But that's a slippery slope. First it's one cat, then two, and before you know it you're the crazy cat lady.$2#$b#Plus Titania would bully them. I'll stick to birds.$7",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Sat10": "I got an invitation to the next meeting of the council. I don't know whether I should go though. What if it's awkward?$2#$b#Still, it's nice to know you can sometimes repair the bridges you've burned. Sometimes literally.$1",
  "Alecto.dialogue.Sun10": "Have I ever used the Shrine of Selfishness? Why, where do you think I got Kevin from?$1#$b#... I'm joking.$6#$e#I was tempted to use the Shrine of Memory on myself after the divorce but unfortunately it only works one way.$2",
  "Alecto.dialogue.winter_17male": "Ugh, it's HIS birthday today.$6#$b#You know, one year I wrote an entire book of romantic poems for him. I had it custom bound for him in leather, gilded edges, the works. I don't think he ever even read it.$2#$e#I should try and break the wards on the tower and steal it back. He doesn't deserve it.$5",
  "Alecto.dialogue.winter_17female": "Ugh, it's HER birthday today.$6#$b#You know, one year I wrote an entire book of romantic poems for her. I had it custom bound for her in leather, gilded edges, the works. I don't think she ever even read it.$2#$e#I should try and break the wards on the tower and steal it back. She doesn't deserve it.$5",

  "Alecto.dialogue.rain.2": "I hear there's a trick to staying dry in the rain. To walk through the storm between the raindrops.$7#$b#I never mastered it. I'll stick to water-repelling charms.",
  "Alecto.dialogue.rain.3": "Lovely weather, isn't it?$6#$b#Normally I love a rainy day but this one's a little too gray and grimy.",
  "Alecto.dialogue.locational.1": "Sometimes I see the villagers scurrying around.",
  "Alecto.dialogue.locational.2": "That Elliott's rather dreamy, isn't he? Oh, don't worry, I'm not in the market for a boy toy.$1",
  "Alecto.dialogue.locational.3": "That Emily girl vexes me. Such an open mind, but she insists on filling it with nonsense... oh well. Whatever makes her happy, I suppose.$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.locational.4": "That artist - Leia? Laura? Lulu? - she's got a good eye. For art and for foraging. Very impressive.",
  "Alecto.dialogue.locational.5": "If that poor fool Marnie doesn't get it together and break it off with Lewis...$5#$b#What a horrid little man. Even a wet blanket like her deserves someone who will treat her properly.$5",
  "Alecto.dialogue.locational.6": "Would you belive that Penny reminds me of myself at that age? The poor, sweet fool.$2#$b#Unfortunately there's no spell to give someone else a bit of backbone. That takes time and experience, I'm afraid.$2",
  "Alecto.dialogue.locational.7": "Abigail. Oh Abigail. Such a pretty little thing. Vivacious. Full of excitement and adventure. She'll learn.$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.locational.8": "Jio should take that scarf off now and then. If he's going to skulk around the place he could at least be decorative while he does it.$7",
  "Alecto.dialogue.locational.9": "I swear, if that junimo threatens to stab me one more time I'll make a fruit salad out of her.$5",
  "Alecto.dialogue.locational.10": "If Lenny ever ran for mayor she'd have my vote. She seems much more fun than her brother.$1",
  "Alecto.dialogue.locational.11": "That little waitress girl shows promise as a warrior. Maybe she could give you a few tips.$7",
  "Alecto.dialogue.locational.12": "I should drop by the research lab some time and have a chat with Aguar.",
  "Alecto.dialogue.alectointroduction": "Only people with strong magical affinity can see through invisibility spells like the one I'm currently using.#$b#Unfortunately, that includes small children. Ugh.$5",
  "Alecto.dialogue.junasign": "Have you met Juna yet, @? Oh, you're in for a treat!$1",
  "Alecto.dialogue.junacave": "I hear you're part of the elite club of people allowed in Juna's cave. Charming, isn't it?$6#$b#Makes me feel like my living situation is downright luxurious in comparison.$1",
  "Alecto.dialogue.junagone": "Without Juna around, my social calendar is even sparser than usual.$2",
  "Alecto.dialogue.junawizard": "As long as Juna's staying with Ras, my social calendar is even sparser than usual.$2",

  "Alecto.dialogue.junabirthday": "Juna's out frolicking with her carpenter tonight so I won't be able to catch up with her.$6#$b#Give her this from me, would you? [561]",
  "Alecto.dialogue.keahiprank": "Ugh! What's that awful smell?$3#$b#It's you? Well go away and wash yourself, then!$5",
  "Alecto.dialogue.lucikielarrives": "So there's a demon in town? It seems that when the ignorant mess around with powers they cannot comprehend it's everyone else who as to suffer for it.$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.lucikielreputation": "That delectable demon's made quite a name for himself, hasn't he?$1#$b#Oh hush, I'm old, not dead.$7",

  "Alecto.dialogue.hosttreemistletoe": "Mistletoe berries are an extremely potent and versatile potion igredient, but I've been having trouble finding any lately.$2",
  "Alecto.dialogue.meetthecats": "Those cats had better not bully Kevin. They don't seem like the mean sort, though.$7",
  "Alecto.dialogue.alectowizardtower": "I'd really rather not talk about what happened at the tower, if it's all the same to you.$6",
  "Alecto.dialogue.alectowellwickevent": "...dammit. I should have teleported myself out of the tower instead of hiding in the cauldron, of all things. Now my clothes stink of Ras's terrible potions.$2",
