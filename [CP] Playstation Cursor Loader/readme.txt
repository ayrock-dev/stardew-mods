How to edit the cursor of your own:
1 - You need xnbcli (https://github.com/LeonBlade/xnbcli/releases) to unpack XNB files. If it's already PNG skip to step 3
2 - Place Cursors.xnb in "Pack" folder then click "Unpack.exe", your unpacked files will be placed in "Unpack" folder.
3 - Edit your Cursors.xnb with an image editor that supports transparency like paint.net
4 - Place your edited Cursor.png to the mod's "assets" folder or pack the .png files as .xnb again. 
5 - Done.
6 - Alternatively you can make your own .png cursor with 130x30 resolution and place your "Cursor.png" to the mod's "assets".
