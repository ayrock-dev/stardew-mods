* Lot of new dialogue for all seasons in Year 1.
* Added a check for if it's raining on the Spring 3rd 1st year. Aspen's unique dialogue will trigger instead of the usual rain one.
* Fixed the map, added text when hovering over her farm without NPCMapLocations
* Also hid name of farm on map before the railroad is unblocked
* Added Fall and Winter outfits if Seasonal Outfits are enabled
* Added a beach outfit
* Updated warps to be used on CP and not built into the maps
* Changed internal naming of custom maps
* Some fixes to railroad
* The railroad doesn't require "extra layers" mod anymore to look normal, but her farm and house still do.
* SVR2 compatibility fixed (SVR2 still needs to be updated for 1.6, though.)

Planned content for next update:
* Fixing any bugs that appeared during this update
* Adding fish to Aspen's farm
* Heart events for that will delve more into Aspen's insecurities
* Heart events that will interact with some villagers during Summer
* More unique schedules for fall winter and spring
* DaisyNiko recolor support
